  description: "Refactored to suit Usage: shut [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n  Shut\
    \ is a tool to manage the lifecycle of pure Python packages. It\n  automates tasks\
    \ such as bootstrapping a project, bumping version numbers,\n  managing changelogs\
    \ and publishing packages to PyPI all the while\n  performing sanity checks.\n\
    \n  Shut makes strong assumptions on the project structure and assumes that\n\
    \  the source-control system of choice is Git.\n\nOptions:\n  -C, --cwd path \
    \         Run as if shut was started inside the specified\n                  \
    \        directory.\n\n  -v, --verbose           Increase the log verbosity.\n\
    \  -q, --quiet             Quiet mode, wins over --verbose.\n  -W, --disable-warnings\
    \  Disable Python warnings.\n  --version               Show the version and exit.\n\
    \  --help                  Show this message and exit.\n\nCommands:\n  changelog\
    \    Show changelogs or create new entries.\n  classifiers  List or search package\
    \ classifiers on PyPI.\n  conda-forge  Utility to update conda-forge recipes.\n\
    \  license      Get license information from DejaCode.\n  mono         Manage\
    \ the current mono repository.\n  pkg          Manage the Python package in the\
    \ current directory. packging tool"
